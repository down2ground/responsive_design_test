# What's that

Attempt of creating responsive documentation design.


# Status and problems

The solution works much better that it did. But it needs more study of HTML flexible design 
implementation.

- The following setting:

    ````wrapped
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
    ````
    
    in files `doc_src/templates/multipage.html` and `doc/layout/styles.css`.

- The best practices in activating and deactivating of the sidebar. Now it's done using
    JavaScript but probably pure CSS would be better. Also see
    [here](https://codepen.io/markcaron/pen/wdVmpB).

- If possible improve look and feel on mobile devices.
